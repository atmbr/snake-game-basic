# Basic Snake Game
This is a simple little project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's just a small game to learn a bit about how programming works. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing that ruins the gameplay!

<p>This game was designed only for the PC version, so itâ€™s not playable on mobile devices. It can only be played with a keyboard, and the screen size is also different, so it may not work well on other devices.</p>

<p>This project really helped me practice programming logic and DOM manipulation. Feel free to try it out and send improvement suggestions!</p>"
